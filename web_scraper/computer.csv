This is a truly unique opportunity to help shape AI safety at an international level. We are intent on pulling in the best technical talent from academia and industry, and we move at a pace befitting the need to stay on top of cutting edge AI development.  Our top priorities are to:Develop and conduct evaluations on advanced AI systems: We will characterise safety-relevant capabilities, understand the safety and security of systems, and assess their societal impacts.Drive foundational AI safety research: We will launch moonshot research projects and convene world-class external researchers.Facilitate information exchange: We will establish clear information-sharing channels between the Institute and other national and international actors.  These include external stakeholders, such as private companies and academia.Our research teams are organised around five Workstreams. The Platform Team is cross-functional, supporting all of these teams work.Chem/bio: studying how LLMs and more specialised AI systems are advancing biological and chemical capabilities relating to harmful outcomes.Cyber: studying how LLMs and more specialised AI systems may aid in cyber-criminality, and the adequacy of cybersecurity measures against AI systems.Safeguards: evaluating the strength and efficacy of safety and security components of frontier AI systems against diverse threats which could circumvent safeguards.Societal harms: evaluating threats to societal fabric from frontier AI. For example, entrenching biases, promoting skewed or radical views, and systemic discrimination.Loss of control: testing for precursors to loss of control by measuring relevant capabilities in long-horizon computer-based tasks, for example sub-tasks of  autonomous replication, AI development and self-improvement, etc.You will lead our Platform Team of software engineers and research engineers.Through a blend of ML tooling and infrastructure, data and pipeline management, web development, and data visualisation, the Platform Team enables AISIs core work of evaluating cutting edge Frontier AI Systems.
